# Movielens-Capstone-Project
 <h6>Description and Motivation</h6>
                            <p>This was the first of two Capstone Projects as part of the Harvard Data Science Professional Certification. 
                                Given various input features, create a model that will predict the movie rating.

                            <h6>Business Value</h6>
                            <p>A regression model, which is the type of predictive model used to solve this analytical problem, 
                                is a cornerstone of supervised learning and is therefore extremely valuable in any business context. 
                                The extension to this would be to build a recommender system. Accurate predictions of how much a user
                                 would like a particular movie would allow for more informed recommendations and thus more user engagement.

                            <p>
                                The primary challenge for me was actually to not get overwhelmed by the sheer number of 
                                algorithms and approaches one could employ for multivariate regression. 
                                Feeling very much like I was wading into an ocean, I had to remind myself to not get bogged down by each and every detail whilst still remain methodical and focused.
